The follow technologies are used like most VML projects:

* jQuery
* Bootstrap
* LoDash
* Node.js and NPM
* SCSS
* Grunt


## Assumptions

* The project sturcture is similar to what you will encounter with a VML project.
* Bootstrap is include for use.
* jQuery and LoDash are already for use.


## Don'ts

* Use inline styling
* Include any Javascript in the HTML file


## Instructions

1. Install project dependencies through the Command Line
2. Make sure the `app.scss` file is compiling into the `APP` directory.
3. Add HTML markup for a button and text input field
4. Style the button to match creative using `SCSS`.
5. Style the input field using Bootstrap's classes.
6. Add functionally to the button so that when it's clicked a modal will pop up and display text that as been enter into the input box.


## Extra Challenge

1. Uncomment the include list in the HTML file.
2. Use Javascript to create an array from the values in the list.
3. Modify the click function to filter the array based on what is entered into the text box.
4. Display the filtered results in the modal window.


## Bonus

* Use a responsive container in your HTML
* Create the arrow using CSS shapes.
* Initialize Javascript with out using $(document).ready()
* Change button color and size based media queries
* Use BEM CSS class syntax in your HTML
